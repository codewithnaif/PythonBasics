It is easy to read and write because it uses simple english-like syntax.\n","\n","It is so popular because:\n","1. Easy to Learn – Its simple syntax makes it beginner-friendly.\n","2. Versatile – It is used in web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.\n","3. Large Community – Many people use Python, so it’s easy to find help and resources.\n","4. Many Libraries – Python has a lot of ready-made tools (libraries) for different tasks.\n","5. Free and Open Source – Anyone can use it without paying.\n","\n","#2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n","An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs the Python code line by line.\n","#3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","Pre-defined keywords are special words in Python that have fixed meanings and uses, like `if`, `else`, `for`, `True`, etc.\n","\n","#4) Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved by Python for specific tasks.\n","\n","#5) What is mutability in Python?\n","Mutability means if a value can be changed after it is created. If yes, it is mutable; if no, it is immutable.\n","\n","#6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","Lists are designed to change data (add, remove, update), but tuples are fixed, which makes them safer and faster in some cases.\n","\n","#7) What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","`==` checks if values are equal.\n","`is` checks if two things are the same object in memory.\n","\n","#8) What are logical operators in Python?\n","Logical operators are used to combine conditions:\n","1. `and` (both true)\n","2. `or` (any one true)\n","3. `not` (reverse the result)\n","\n","#9) What is type casting in Python?\n","Type casting means changing one data type to another, like turning a string into an integer.\n","\n","#10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","*   Implicit: Python changes the type automatically.\n","*   Explicit: We change the type using functions like int(), str(), etc.\n","\n","#11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Conditional statements help run different code depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n","\n","#12) How does the elif statement work?\n","`elif` checks another condition `if` the first if is false. It comes between `if` and `else`.\n","\n","#13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","* for loop: Runs a set number of times.\n","* while loop: Runs until a condition becomes false.\n","\n","#14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","When we don't know how many times to run the loop, like waiting for user input to type “exit”."],"metadata":{"id":"H1YYoZTLMMes"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **PRACTICAL QUESTIONS**"],"metadata":{"id":"-0jzd6pQRKUD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\""],"metadata":{"id":"_8sQJ-nkU9jc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Hello, World!\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"P_mgGNaAQl8V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744365588855,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28,"user":{"displayName":"Naif","userId":"04792772835531511803"}},"outputId":"59a40782-da93-4811-bad0-1f82cb6abf1a"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Write a Python program that displays your name and age"],"metadata":{"id":"uFrBkbYpU7XA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# name and age of the user\n","name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n","age = int(input(\"What is your age? \"))\n","print(f\"Your name is {name} and you are {age} years old\") # f-string used for formating"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fZL735qkSmHc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744365638016,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7298,"user":{"displayName":"Naif","userId":"04792772835531511803"}},"outputId":"0307d928-a303-4676-cf43-1b3f83fadb77"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["What is your name?
